# guindous Kodi repository for left behind great plugins!
This git repo works as Kodi repo for some great plugins that stopped working in Kodi 19.
My work is to take those forgotten plugins that I use, make it compatible, and host them until their migration or lack of willing.

Download [repository.guindous-1.0.1.zip](https://github.com/guindous/repository.guindous/raw/master/zips/repository.guindous/repository.guindous-1.0.1.zip) to [install in kodi](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file).

__Disclaimer__: I'm not a python expert and  most of this work is a Q&D migration. Expect rough edges: poor language use, non tested scenarios, etc. Only warranty is that works in my environment. If you have any inconvenience, post an issue in the forked repos.
